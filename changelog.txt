    - There is now a TSM shortcut item that gives access to admin only GUI based
      copy priorities.  You can copy the priorities of a surface to another surface,
      or export to a text file and import that into a new save.  The import requires
      the actual text content not the file name.
  Bugfixes:
    - Before first priority creation, if you passed a signal (ie direct connection)
      to a requester station, this would cause a crash.  Now fixed.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixes crash caused by using BPs wit TSM objects and editing the BP.

Version: 0.6.24
Date: 2020/08/13
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected minor issue on api command "update_wc" when setting rb_and
  Features:
    - Added full blueprint support.  To use you must enable via mod settings, map tab,
      "Full blueorint mode".  In addition you must confirm the blueprint ie use the
      blueprint item, not the copy tool or the cut tool.  Also, this does not automatically
      work with old blueprints, only new ones.  The effect is that requester (lamps) will
      be built with the full details priority schema, hide flag, requester priority set per
      original in addition to everything else in the blueprint.  You can turn this on and
      off for all blueprints voa the mod settings map feature at any time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.23
Date: 2020/08/06
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected crash on placement of requester stop without first defining a priority
      ie now either order is fine
  Features:
    - New remote enabled functions interface "TSM-API" provided
    - remote.call("TSM-API","list_priorities","surface") - returns table of priorities,
      surface is optional to limit output to single surface, and requires surface.nAme
      eg "nauvis"
    - remote.call("TSM-API", "define_new_priority","icon1", "icon2", "stationlist", "surface")
      creates a new priority schema - icon1 and icon2 are mandatory, stationlist is an array
      of station names, surface is surface name, defaults to "nauvis"
    - remote.call("TSM-API", "update_wc","icon1", "icon2", "wc", "surface") updates the wait
      conditions of an existing priority.  wc is an array (only items that you are changing
      are required).  The following are legal and set to the defaults -
      {rb_or = true, rb_and = false, inc_ef = true, empty = true, full = false, inactivity = true,
      inact_int = 5, wait_timer = false, wait_int = 30, count = false, count_amt = 1000,
      count_ddn = 1}.  surface is optional default "nauvis"
    - remote.call("TSM-API", "append_station", "icon1", "icon2", "stationlist", "surface")
      appends stations to the specified priority.  Stationlist is an array. Surface optional
    - remote.call("TSM-API", "prepend_station", "icon1", "icon2", "stationlist", "surface")
      inserts stations at the beginning of the station list to the specified priority.
      Stationlist is an array. Surface optional
    - All of these can be called directly in the console - use "/c"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.22
Date: 2020/08/02
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected error in event causing crash (added then)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.21
Date: 2020/08/02
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed debug count that was generated if using the refuelling consist combinator
    - Fixed duplicate lamp crash
    - Fixed new surface crash on using BP for first request station (with requester)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.20
Date: 2020/07/05
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash from placing requester station where the train counter cannot be
      placed.
    - Fixed issue when opening new requester without closing last - still used to
      show the old requester details.
    - Fixed under some circumstances a requester thinks it has already created an
      outstanding request when it has not.  Now there is an extra validation to check
      the existence of the outstanding request else the requester proceeds to try to
      match trains to its requirement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.19
Date: 2020/06/15
  Features:
    - Previously if a requester called a train that couldn't immediately be supplied
      then the request became an outstanding request.  When a train became available
      it would immediately fulfill an existing outstanding request.  Now the requester
      is rechecked to see if the requirement still exists before sending the train.
    - Two new commands added - /tsm_export - will write the contents of your priorities
      to a file (like a BP); /tsm_import - will import the priorities from your file
      (credit to billbo99 for these commands)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.18
Date: 2020/05/24
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash due to nil requester during requester update
  Features:
    - Now instead of batch processing requesters, only one requester will be responded to
      on any one tick.  As the train counter usually takes at least one tick to update, this
      change will likely prevent unexpected duplicate train calls.  The interval (in ticks)
      between train calls can be set in mod map settings.  Lower numbers will impair updates
      performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.17
Date: 2020/05/17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash due to invalid requester during requester update

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      station unable to request new trains until /tsm_reset or requester replace
    - Fixed a possible cause of multiple trains responding to very first requester call if
      demand is present during the adding of priority to the requester
    - Fixed rare crash event "control.lua:2386: bad argument #1 of 2 to 'pairs' (table
      expected, got nil)"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.15
Date: 2020/04/17
  Features:
    - The auto rename for preventing duplicate requester function now tries to find a
      numeric value to increment in the last two characters of the station name.
      Otherwise it now appends '01'.
  Bugfixes:
    - Graphical display issues with the train counter should now be resolved

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.14

      counter

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.11
Date: 2020/03/09

    - Train configuration reader (for refuelling stations) now has a third
      signal that provides the location of the second locomotive from the
      front of the train. Used to enable distinguishing 4-8-0 from
      1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 for example

    - Removed debug text
  Features:
    - Requester priorities now default to 50.  Existing requesters will be incremented
      by 49 to bring them into line with the new default.  This is to make it easier to
      increase the priority on a requester (lower the number to increase priority)

    - Fixed key "type" not found ... control.lua 255

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
Date: 2019/15/09
  Bugfixes:
    - Fatal error when removing requester station is fixed
    - If a requester station was removed leaving an orphaned requester that is also
      active, that requester would start calling trains to station " ".  This would
      happen even if a new requester station replaced the old.  This is fixed in two
      ways - first, a blank requester will now never call trains; second - the
      handling when there is a replacement requester station now works correctly.
  Features:
    - The name of the station that the requester believes it belongs to is now the
      very last line of the gui detail for the requester.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3
Date: 2019/12/09

Version: 0.5.1
Date: 2019/11/09
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected crash line 311 of control-util
    - Fixed requester graphic (now shows R not P)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2019/10/09
  Features:
    - Priorities are now defined by both the resource icon and the id icon
    - Wait conditions allow for item/fluid count to be used. This is based on whether the
      resource icon is an item or a fluid - virtual has no affect and will not generate a
      count wait condition.
    - Requesters can be updated directly via the GUI using the new "e" button (reselect
      via the "e" button to close)
    - Requesters can be hidden from the default Outstanding Requests view. In addition,
      when in the Outstanding Requests view, players can unhide all the hidden requesters
      by toggle.
    - Map ping requester now shows a minimap in the centre of the screen in addition to
      adding an icon to map view. You can close the minimap by clicking anywhere else on
      the screen.
    - The train counter (entity attached to the foot of the requester train station) now
      records the resource of each train inbound based on the resource icon on the priority.
      This is recorded as a positive number. The trains on the way signal continues to be
      generated as a total count.
    - You can now supply a negative resource signal direct to a Requester Train Stop to
      request a train of that resource. The source of the train will always be locked to the
      double icon priority for that resource (eg if you supply a negative 1 iron plate to the
      Requester train stop, then that is identical effect to activating a requester using
      priority scheme iron plate - iron plate).
    - Duplicate Requester Train Stops are now actively prevented from occurring. The mod will
      automatically rename the station by appending an "X" until a unique name is found.
    - The priority setup is now indexed by surface so all information, priorities etc are
      distinct and reusable on multi-surface worlds.
    - Performance of the mod has been improved up to 50% depending on the specifics of your
      world.
    - You can now copy the requestor priority information to other requesters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.9
Date: 2019/04/05
  Bugfixes:
    - Copying a requester station with active requester (including
      copying station name) then changing resource and renaming
      the new station was leading to deliveries of the wrong

Date: 2018/21/12
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rare error warning message - "attempt to index field
      'sub_index' (a nil value)"
  Changes:
    - validation now enforces that the priority schema "ID" field is
      unique
  Features:
    - you can now edit a priority schema to access the wait condition
      parser.  This provides a GUI interface to change the default wait
      conditions given to any train assigned a schedule by this
      priority.  For new priority schemas, you need to save the initial
      station selection first then go back in under edit mode.
    - you can now assign a process priority to the requester entity.
      This will affect the order in which requesters are processed when
      there are outstanding requests.  A priority of "1" is highest and
      the default.  Positive numbers only are accepted, and the higher
      the positive number the lower the process priority.
    - refer new demo example (replacing old multi-station) for the new
      functionality at work

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.13
Date: 2018/17/12
  Features:
    - Adds a train configuration combinator for use at FuelStopx only.
      The combinator will enable differentiation between rolling stock
      configurations so that for example you can correctly refuel 1-1-1s
      and 1-2-1 trains on the same network.
    - Add new startup mod setting to switrch admin only on or off for
      editing the priority schemas
  Bugfixes:
    - Addresses a rare crash on train count signal lost
    - Addresses the station dropdown in the edit list sometimes shows
      duplicates
    - Addresses leftover debug messages

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.12
Date: 2018/15/12
  Bugfixes:
    - Addresses crash caused by removing all of a train's schedule as
      the train pulls into a train station
    - Addresses using blueprints to place requester's results in
      inoperable requester
    - Addresses when requester station is unreachable all available
      trains from the corresponding depot are deployed to that stop
    - Addresses an issue that could deactivate one train on the way
      signal (across entire network) when removing requester train stops

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.11
Date: 2018/13/12
  Features:
    - the ability to use more than one supply station in a schedule. As
      long as the station "wait until" condition is set as "cicuit" then
      the supply station will remain in the schedule.  This allows for
      from 1 ... n supply stations in the schedule where n is
      arbitrarily large (no limit).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.10
Date: 2018/12/12
  Bugfixes:
    - Addresses "trains stopped working" - in addition if you have this
      issue you need to run command "/fix_requests" to repair the
      database

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.9
Date: 2018/12/12
  Bugfixes:
    - Addresses error from on_configuration_changed (refer hanes)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.8
Date: 2018/10/12
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix to defend against possible desync issues in large MP maps.
      On_configuration_changed changes to global data is now on a delta
      basis rather than table rebuild basis.
    - Also the map ping now places the icon on the map at the requesters
      location, moved to the right 5 tiles so it is not directly over
      the train station.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.7
Date: 2018/07/12
  Features:
    - Added delete priority functionality (admin only), validated
      against requesters and outstanding requests - the prirority must
      not be used in either. To help you find these requesters or
      outstanding requests, there is now a map ping feature available on
      the 'RQ' tab and 'R' tab respectively

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.6

    - Fixes an issue in pre-existing games that added the mod after the
      event.  Existing trains may not be recognised properly by the mod.
      The train table is now rebuilt on configuration changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2018/07/12
  Bugfixes:
    - An issue could previously arise where if you were using duplicate
      requester train stops and then deleting one, the requesters may
      retain their original default backer name rather than be updated
      correctly with the new name.  You can verify if this is the case
      by scanning your 'R' screen list.  This update will stop this from
      occurring. Also, the command "/fix_requests" will correct any
      historic occurrence of this issue - run only once.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2018/06/12
